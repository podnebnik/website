### Notes

- Some unused imports may indicate missing functionality that should be implemented rather than removed
- Example files should demonstrate clean TypeScript patterns without unused code
- Callback parameters that are part of API contracts should be prefixed with underscore (\_) when not used
- TypeScript compilation must pass without errors after cleanup
- Commit after every task, exclude `.github` folder
- if we encountered an issue during task, document it.
- every additional document you created, must include some metadata, including when was the last changed made even thou the developer can find out in git history, but for normal user is easier to check

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Analyze and Categorize Unused Imports by Type

  - [x] 1.1 Examine `vroce.tsx` unused SolidJS imports (`createSignal`, `onCleanup`) to determine if reactive state management was intended
  - [x] 1.2 Investigate `vroce.tsx` unused utility imports (`throttle`, `announce`) by checking if UX enhancements were planned
  - [x] 1.3 Review `types/components.ts` unused imports (`LoadingState`, `WeatherReading`) to verify they're not needed in type definitions
  - [x] 1.4 Document findings in comments for imports that indicate missing functionality vs genuinely unused imports

  - [x] 2.3 Remove unused utility imports (`throttle`, `announce`) from `vroce.tsx` if no UX features are missing
  - [x] 2.4 Verify all remaining imports in cleaned files are actually used

- [x] 2.0 Clean Up Genuine Unused Imports and Type Definitions

  - [x] 2.1 Remove unused `LoadingState` and `WeatherReading` imports from `code/types/components.ts`
  - [x] 2.2 Clean up unused SolidJS imports from `vroce.tsx` if no reactive state management is needed
  - [x] 2.3 Remove unused utility imports (`throttle`, `announce`) from `vroce.tsx` if no UX features are missing
  - [x] 2.4 Verify all remaining imports in cleaned files are actually used

- [ ] 3.0 Handle Unused Variables and Parameters

- [ ] 3.0 Handle Unused Variables and Parameters

  - [ ] 3.1 Fix unused `batchId` variable in `code/ali-je-vroce/utils/batchRequests.ts` (either use for logging or remove)
  - [ ] 3.2 Handle unused `error` parameter in `code/ali-je-vroce/utils/errorRecovery.ts` callback (prefix with underscore or use)
  - [ ] 3.3 Fix unused `options` variable in `code/examples/types-example/weather-visualization.tsx`
  - [ ] 3.4 Address unused `data` parameter in `code/examples/types-example/query-patterns.ts` onSuccess callback

- [ ] 4.0 Review and Clean Up Example Files

  - [ ] 4.1 Remove or properly use unused generic type parameters `T` in `query-patterns.ts` utility functions
  - [ ] 4.2 Clean up `weather-visualization.tsx` to demonstrate proper TypeScript patterns without unused variables
  - [ ] 4.3 Ensure example files serve as good TypeScript reference implementations
  - [ ] 4.4 Update example file comments to explain TypeScript-specific patterns and best practices

- [ ] 5.0 Validate TypeScript Compilation and Functionality
  - [ ] 5.1 Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify zero compilation errors after cleanup

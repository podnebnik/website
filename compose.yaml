# How to use this:
# Install docker and docker-compose
# First build the images with this command: docker-compose -f compose.yaml build
# Then when you want to run the system, run: docker-compose -f compose.yaml up

services:
  # base image is a base for website
  # this image includes fetching and installing all the relevant libraries
  base:
    image: podnebnik/base:1.0
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: deployment/Dockerfile.dev.base

  # website is the runner for yarn
  website:
    depends_on:
      - base # website needs to have base image built before
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: deployment/Dockerfile.dev.website
    volumes:
      - .:/build
    command:

    ports:
      # you can change the 8003 to something else if it clashes on your system
      - "8003:8080"
      # this is a websocket port that 11ty seems to use for something, not sure what
      # do not change this line below
      - "24678:24678"

  # datasette, the database interface behind podnebnik
  datasette:
    build:
